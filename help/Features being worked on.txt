A lot of stuff is being worked on it's just not in the downloadable viewer yet
because I'm completely rewriting the viewer since the current one was just a
"make something that actually works" sort of thing.
This means that all the features I'm working on can't really be ported back since
the way the viewer works is completely different and I don't want to maintain two
different viewers.

You can request some features be added if you want them and if they're small enough
I can quickly hack them in to the current viewer

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Features being worked on for full release:

Copy text to clipboard
Note: The way the viewer processes the scene and javascript security limitations
makes it so that this is quite difficult to do and would recquire me to rewrite the
way the scene processes (which I already am) when it is implemented it also may
only work in manual mode because of javascript security limitations.


Easier way to manage favorites
Note: It was a last minute addition that I thought would be nice to have and I'd improve it later, I just really don't want to mess with any UI stuff in the current
viewer because it was thrown together in like 5 minutes and will break easily.


Tag linking
Note: Searching cream pie would bring up anything tagged nakadashi

Backlog
Note: Backlog on the scene clickable text to replay voiced lines, what you'd
expect from a backlog.


Tag editor (probably later)
Note: View a scene/characters tags and be able to edit them with a nice UI and export the tag list, really just a QoL thing for people that want good tags.


Translation assistant for translators (probably later)
Note: Just something to work on when I'm bored and don't feel like working on the
viewer. Hopefully it will make the lives of people who want to translate some scenes
easier.
